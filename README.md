Luke's Prom Photo Booth
-----------------------

*I created this small piece of program to set up a photo booth at my high school's prom dance. I used C and Gtk+-2.0 for most of the functionalities, and several shell script to help out. For controlling the camera, I used [gphoto2](http://www.gphoto.org/proj/gphoto2/) ([sourceforge](http://gphoto.sourceforge.net/)). 

*This is NOT a generic program yet, but I will try to use my spare time to accomplish it. 
    *For now, you can't do anything other than use my default template, template layout, and other stuff.
    *It only works on Linux.

*The way it works is the users enter their last names, and take 3 pictures to use. Then they will go to the screen where a pre-loaded template is presented and the 3 candidates can be drag and drop to the site users desired.

*The main purpose of this repo is (possibly) for the next year's prom(I am graduating this year, 2013). Hopefully someone is capable of using this program.
